Data for back was collected by applying pressure to the back of the mannequin head. Data involved pushing on the head and allowing the spring to go back slowly in some cases
and quickly in others.

left:
Data for front was collected by applying pressue to the left side of the mannequin head(from the mannequins perspective). Data involved pushing on the head and allowing the spring to go back slowly in some cases
and quickly in others.

negative (fixed):
Data for negative was collected by allowing the mannequin head to sit still. Also allowed for small movements in the head that shouldn't be detected as either direction.
Negative was created inorder to tell the ML learning that neither direction should be detected. 
(fixed implies that I was able to seperate the data correctly for each instance) This is the only data I was able to seperate correctly. The rest need to be fixed.
